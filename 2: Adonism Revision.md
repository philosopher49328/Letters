Adonis is an idea. Adonis is the perfect man. Adonism is the pursuit of being like Adonis.

Adonis is indescribable beyond that he is perfect. There are words that might help to foggily articulate what Adonis is. A few words I have come up with are listed below.

- Fortitude
- Ambition
- Self-Discipline
- Humility
- Wisdom
- Love
- Gratitude
- Presence
- Leadership

Of course, there is no guarantee that any of them always apply. But one can imagine that Adonis is generally fortitudinous rather than weak-willed and faint-hearted. It is likely a lot easier to determine what Adonis wouldn't do rather than what he would do.

Adonism accepts the difficulty in defining an ideal man.
