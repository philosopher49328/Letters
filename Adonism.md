# Philosophy in Practice
I have spent a good chunk of the last few months learning about and studying and discussing philosophy with people I know, people online, mostly Stoics. I have spent this time because Stoicism has brought me a lot of value and truly changed my life for the better. I quickly picked up on this value and pursued it because of the interesting nature of the different contrasting perspectives on the fundamental questions of humanity. This is what I have realized. After time spent learning Epicureanism, Stoicism, Aristotelianism, Deontology, Utilitarianism, Virtue Ethics, Satanism, Nietzcheism, etc. I have found little to apply beyond the Dichotomy of Control. These questions are interesting to ponder, but they do not improve anything but my knowledge of them. I realize that I need to focus on my goals and the practical application of them, so I have devised one contribution I can make to philosophy that may or may not prove to be anything more than immature and idiotic. Nonetheless I will attempt to inform you, the reader, and argue for the merit of such a system. Once I have clearly written my thoughts somewhere that won't be lost, that I can come back and appreciate or cringe at, I can focus on the practical and be better in life instead of in theory.

### Adonism
The foundation of all behavior by conscious beings is driven by the pursuit of pleasure or the avoidance of pain. It is unavoidable. Eudaimonia is an ancient greek concept used to describe living in a way that is in accordance with nature and that is also characterized by the kind of lasting happiness and tranquility that should be pursued above all else. To be eudaimon, then, is to be at the very best of what it is to be human. What leads to Eudaimonia then? Drugs? Sex? Sensual pleasure? No. These lead away from eudaimonia. There is science behind this, but briefly, by indulging in highly physically pleasurable activities, you actually harm your dopamine receptors, health, and motivation. You are choosing short-term pleasure over long-term pleasure, and by doing so, you are causing, however little, long-term pain. So what leads to Eudaimonia? Human greatness, otherwise known as virtue. Think of the greatest humans you know and you will know some level of virtue. Many of the greatest humans we commonly think of possessed strength of will. The most fortitudinous and self-disciplined among us are often seen as some of the most great. But you may also think of those who are great with regard to the mind. Those with wisdom, intellect, and who make good judgements are also to be looked up to. Finally, there are many who are great in their humanity. The man who loves everything in the universe with all that he has is great. Some of the greatest people are the ones who are the most loving. Finally, the most despicable are those with the opposite of love, self-discipline, fortitude, or wisdom: hate, gluttony, weakness, and folly.

We can imagine a man who is perfectly great. We call that man Adonis and we strive to be more like him. He is perfectly self-disciplined, never allowing his base temptations to impede or alter his judgement or actions. He is perfectly fortitudinous, resisting and persisting through the greatest adversity and fear imaginable. He is perfectly wise, never making a fallacious or rushed judgement. He is perfectly loving. Adonis loves all that is from his worst enemy to fate itself. Some that are unlike Adonis hate him for who he is. He does not anger quickly or hate them. He treats them with love, warmth, brotherhood, and justice. He never suspects anyone's betrayal but nonetheless makes use of appropriate discretion. Adonis speaks in quotes. When I say this, I mean that Adonis is an abstraction, a projection of human greatness onto one man; Therefore, all of what he says and does can be likened to a collage or montage of human greatness. We can only define Adonis through vague adjectives such as wisdom, self-discipline, fortitude, and love.

**On a side note, self-discipline and fortitude are maybe more aptly described simply as strength.**
