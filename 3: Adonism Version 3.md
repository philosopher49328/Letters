> "Be like the cliff against which the waves continually break; but it stands firm and tames the fury of the water around it. - Marcus Aurelius

The foundation of masculinity is stillness, like the cliff upon which the waves will break for all time. The feminine is the movement, the turbulent and extravagant force of nature.

The feminine is characterized by movement, change, turbulence. Emotional outbursts, reliance, tenderness.
The masciline is characterized by stillness, permanence, and order. Emotional stability, independence, strength, rationality.

Adonis:
Adonis is the truly masculine man, perfectly loving, perfectly strong in will, perfectly prudent.

We can't know much more than this about Adonis. People who try to fix their ideology on him are being ignorant, for there is no way to know for certain what Adonis believes, says, or does beyond vaguenesses.

For example there are some traits that are hard to imagine Adonis not possessing, but of course one can't know for sure how accurate these descriptions are. These virtues are listed below:

> - Love
> - Fortitude
> - Self-Discipline
> - Wisdom
> - Patience
> - Presence
> - Humility
> - Ambition
> - Leadership
> - Gratitude

Of course these overlap, could go on forever, and are obviously not perfect. There are no perfect virtues or ideas that can attributed to Adonis. Theory around Adonism is necessarily cloudy and difficult for Adonis would likely not spend his time arguing in hypotheticals. The man who is good in actuality is better than the man who is good in theory.

>Waste no more time arguing what a good man should be. Be one." - Marcus Aurelius
